// It appears that SPM requires the presence of at least one source file within the `GeneratedOpenAIClient`
// target to ensure it is recognized as a valid module. Without this file, SPM may not properly expose
// the target, preventing its import in dependent targets.

// This file serves as a placeholder to satisfy SPMâ€™s module resolution requirements, ensuring that
// `GeneratedOpenAIClient` can be correctly referenced and imported in other targets within the package.
